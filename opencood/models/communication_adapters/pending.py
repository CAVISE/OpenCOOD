class PendingModelCommunicationAdapter(ModelCommunicationAdapter):

    Preserve the current dataset-managed payload until a model is split.

    This adapter intentionally performs no model-side encoding. It exists so
    models that have not been migrated yet still use their current payload
    implementation without adding model-name branches to the manager.

    TODO
    ----
    Replace this fallback with model-side adapters for Early, Late and the
    remaining Intermediate models. Each adapter must place the wire boundary
    at the model's real communication stage instead of sending preprocessor
    output by default.
